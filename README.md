# Healthy Eats

Enter the name of a tasty food item and 'Add' it to your plate. You may decide to 'Eat' it or leave it on your plate. No pressure.  

Heroku deployed here for the time being: [vast-spire-19026.herokuapp.com/](https://vast-spire-19026.herokuapp.com/)  

I developed this web app so that I may practice applying the MVC architectural design pattern. MVC is short for 'Model View Controller.'  

Instead of serving static HTML files, I am dynamically rendering HTML using the template engine known as 'Handlebars.js.' Additionally, I created a custom ORM in the Model layer and configured Heroku to use MySQL database.
